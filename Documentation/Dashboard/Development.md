# Manual Replication
1. Clone github in a gitbash terminal via `git clone https://github.com/AceLeft/Interfact-Admin-Dashboard`
2. Get VSCode for your computer via https://code.visualstudio.com/
3. Open the dashboard folder in VSCode. Then, open a terminal in VSCode. First, make sure you cd into /interfact-admin-dashboard/. You may ensure you are in the right folder by typing `ls` into the terminal; you should see many .js and .ts files. Then, run `npm install` to install all of the project's dependencies.
5. Make sure your node.js is > 18.18, if not download from https://nodejs.org/en
6. Download & setup the fontawesome packages by following the instructions on: `https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/use-with/react`
7. In the terminal, type "npm run dev", and wait for the dashboard to compile.
8. On a browser tab on your machine, type "http://localhost:3000" into the address bar.
