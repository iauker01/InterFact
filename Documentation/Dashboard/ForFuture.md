## Known bugs / issues
- The Reports (confirm/deny a user-reported image) cannot show images that are not in the project itself, making the confirmation/denial of if an image is correctly labeled require finding the image itself in the file system
- The opening screen (the page.tsx located in the app folder) is a nothing implementation; the password is hardcoded in and is not visually obscured.


## Future improvements
- Our final changes have not been well tested
