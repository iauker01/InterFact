#### Step three: You will then hit “Add Layer from URL” where you will add in our URL at the top and make sure to select the layer type of GeoJSON for it to work. After you are done with that, hit next and it will add the layer to the map

#### Step five: If you want to see if it is blocked or not, you can hit the orange dot and it will open up a menu that gives details on it

#### That is how you use our application to show what intersection is blocked or not. You can mess around with it to change how it looks.
