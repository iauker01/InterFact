### Topics Discussed

Showed off the Admin Dashboard for Iteration 5 with the fixes to the prediction tables.

### Things Clarified

Showed off the project to the client. 
Likes what we have for the prediction page, but also wanted to look at individual days and hours and not just the whole day and week. 
We could implement it easily since the data is already there.
Asked questions about the request page and if its close to being done.

### How Client used the software

He mainly used it to look at the predictions again along with the buttons added to it.
Asked questions about the snapshot and if it replaces stuff in the firebase.
Still mainly went over the predictions and not much else.
Looked at the request and asked about it.
