### Topics Discussed

We discussed surface-level on what the current state of the project was, and set up a meeting for a more in-depth look.

### Things Clarified

The current design is more like a prototype; it is in Angular, and communicates with Firebase. There is no real backend.
We are to focus on Kyle and the emergency responder's needs first, as they are our primary client. The cameras have a fastest time of 
3 minutes per new image.
The current prototype can be found at interfactlive.web.app

### Topics Discussed

Prof. Ergin gave use a look at how the Firebase is set up, what the cameras look like, and where the project could go.

### Things Clarified

Prof. Ergin reiterated that we will work for Kyle's needs first. We will use the same techstack, Angular and Firebase. We will
initially work using a Firebase emulator until we are ready for the real database. 
If we complete the Emergency Responders needs with ArcGIS, our next task would be an Admin Interface, doing prediction work. The
admin interface is not a web app. If we finish the Admin Interface, we would work on automating the machine learning, moving it
away from a training per-camera to a widely applicable model.
