### Topics Discussed

Showed off the Admin Dashboard for Iteration 3 and beginning plans for iteration 4

### Things Clarified

Product did not fully do what the client wanted. While we do have a report system, it mainly worked with firebase and not with the MySql data format
that the client wanted and sent us. no real way to deploy the Project by itself outside of the github repository. Next iteration shoudl focus on getting
the report and Ids to work with the MySql database. Clarified that we were trying to treat this as working with him as a teacher instead of as a client.

### How Client used the software

He mainly used it to look at the report system and how it functions in the dashboard. Showed us that the report is somewhat confusing with how it works.
He talked about how we will talk about changing the wording of accepting or denying reports to help clarify more what those mean in the dashboard.
He checked out everything else for a couple minutes to show what we should focus on next and what we don't need to worry about in the next iteration like adding intersections, filters, etc.
Worked well on our computers but wouldn't really function well on his since he would be missing certain dependencies.
