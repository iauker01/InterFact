### Topics Discussed

We showed Bradley the project as we had it. We told him we plan to do some error catching. We asked for some ideas for iteration 2.

### Things Clarified

Bradley thought our iteration was pretty solid. He doesn't really have ideas for the second iteration, but he gave the following advice:
- Don't waste time styling.
- Try to stick to one language for the dashboard.
- Don't get caught up on making tables. Use a framework that can quickly make tables.
- Creating a log-in page is a great selling point for yourself, and can help alot with jobs.
