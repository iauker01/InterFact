### Topics Discussed

Showed what we have done so far and went over some problems we have, like the program not working with the clients data or causing an error. 
Went over and fixed one error that was due to how it was reading the Log ID in the code. 
Went over different ways to make the program run smoother as it is currently lagging right now. 
Also facing problems with the data potentially duplicating each time we open the program or adding more. 
Talk about ways that we can train predictions of when it ends or if it will block multiple intersections at once.

### Things Clarified

Told us to talk to the client about the data as it seems bigger than what we thought. 
The prediction code with the hour based system works with the random data but not the client data at this moment.
