### Things Clarified
We clarified the part we want to refactor from the code and what job everyone has to work on for the next iteration.

### Progress Made
First did the pull request for the changes Ethan made the night before. Everyone who was present started working on their part of the project they are supposed to do. Brooke Worked on figuring out how to test adding cameras, with not much success
Ethan started Setting up the ability to delete user reports from users once their report has been reviewed and accepted or denied. Tanner worked on showing the maintenance status if the camera is marked with that status.
Bella got a new laptop before the meeting so she has to get everything set back up.
