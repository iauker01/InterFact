### Topics Discussed

We discussed what remains to be done for the first iteration and began discussion of what the 2nd iteration would look like.

### Things Clarified
We determined that we would need a new meeting with Ergin in order to determine what exactly the requirements are for the Admin Dashboard.
We need to fill out our Deployment.md and User.md files. Ethan said he would do Deployment. Mason said he would work on the 
upcoming presentation. The Admin dashboard will likely be in React.

Ethan also brought up that he has access to a boilerplate site, sasspegasus.com, which we can use next iteration.
