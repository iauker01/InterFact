## Use Cases
+ UC1 A dispatcher finds the quickest route to a target location as first responders make their way there

This is the only necessary use case for the client. The client needs a system that dispatchers
can rely on to help first responders make informed decisions on the quickest and best route to take.
The use cases for this software can be expanded upon in the future but for the requirements the client has
there is only one use case currently.

Flow:
1) Dispatcher Opens the System Dashboard:
- The dispatcher logs into the system and is presented with a map-based
dashboard that shows the status of all monitored train intersections.
2) Check for Blocked Intersections:
- The dashboard clearly marks any blocked intersections
with a red indicator, while clear intersections are marked in green.
- The dispatcher can quickly identify problematic areas from the map overview.
3) View a Blocked Intersection:
- The dispatcher clicks on a red-marked intersection to open the latest picture from the camera feed at the intersection.
4) Verify the Blockage with Visual Data:
- The dispatcher reviews the feed to confirm the blockage or any ongoing issues, ensuring that the status is accurate.\
5) Notify First Responders:
- The Dispatcher uses the information received from the system to advise first responders on the quickest and most efficient route.
