## Front-End
### Angular
Angular is a pretty versatile web framework that gives us multiple options of where to go with the project. It allows us to easily do modulation with our code and test separate parts easily and allows to debug it with its extensions. It also help with getting the updates from the data to our client as well.

### Back-End

### Server
#### Firebase
Since most of the data before we started this project was done with f\Firebase, it made sense to continue with it. 
Firebase also provides three different products that deal with data and work with what we want. These include:
- **Cloud Firestore**

This helps simplify our data and allows for more support to our client and the EMS people to use while they are out on the job.
- **Cloud Functions**

This allows the database to run with the back-end code with changes in the database, like when a picture of a train is sent to say that the crossing is closed.
- **Realtime database**

This is the most important part since the EMS need the product to be updated in real time. The data is stored in a JSON file format which works well with Python and allows updates to Web based support.

### Programming languages

#### python
Since most people have to take a class with python, we saw this as the best option since everyone would have some experience with it. It is also pretty versatile when it comes to Rest APIs. It is a simple language with notations, it also has a good amount of built in libraries and you can easily pull other libraries to it when working with an API. It also works well with JSON and XML which are useful and easy to use with APIâ€™s.

#### C++
C++ is what ArcGIS is made of so it is what we will use to give the data to the client. The main use will be to make a plugin that will give the data to the client since we do not have access to ArcGIS. This will make it easier to give them the data as well and allow their system to look at it.
