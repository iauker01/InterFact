# Business Requirements

## BR1 - Ability for dispatchers to quickly see which train intersections are blocked

In the client meeting this business requirement was the one that stood out as being the most necessary.
The client wants disptchers to be able to very quickly check the status of crossings,
and it was mentioned that the more real time updates can get the better. With this requirement
the client mentioned that it is important to be able to quickly check the images of an intersection
to confirm a blockage.

## BR2 - An API that can be integrated with their existing system

The client said that the best way to eventually integrate into their system would be the use of an API.
It was stated that we will not have access to their system to implement the feature so they need a 
way to retrieve the API from us.
