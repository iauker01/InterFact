# Business Requirements

## BR1 - Ability to quickly see which train intersections are blocked

Users of the Intefact system need to be able to quickly see which train intersections are blocked. 

## BR2 - Add cameras and intersections to Interfact and have them work as expected.

The secondary client wants new intersections and cameras to be easily added to the existing system
so that the Interfact system can expand dynamically. This means we do not have to have budget for cameras,
but a future Interfact business partner can purchase them. 

## BR3 - An admin dashboard that provides reports and merges collected data. 

The secondary client wants to have an admin dashboard that will be used to see reports on collected/merged data. It will also
be used to provide data to a webapp in the future.
