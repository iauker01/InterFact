# Business Requirements

## BR1 - Ability for dispatchers to quickly see which train intersections are blocked

The client wants disptchers to be able to very quickly check the status of crossings,
and it was mentioned that the more real time updates can get the better. It is important to be able to 
quickly check the images of an intersection to confirm a blockage.

## BR2 - Add cameras and intersections to Interfact and have them work as expected.

The secondary client wants new intersections and cameras to be easily added to the existing system
so that the Interfact system can expand dynamically. This means we do not have to have budget for cameras,
but a future Interfact business partner can purchase them. 

## BR3 - An admin dashboard that provides reports and merges colected data. 

The secondary client wants to have an admin dashboard that will be used to see reports on collected/merged data. It will also
be used to provide data to a webapp in the future.
